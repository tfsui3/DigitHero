# DigitHero
 This is a game demo called DigitHero, built with the Unity 2D engine, and implemented using C#. 
 
# Description
Digit Hero is an educational adventure that plunges the player into a world where mathematical prowess is the key to salvation. The game is tailored for elementary school students to reinforce their understanding of basic arithmetic operations concepts. Players assume the role of the Digit Hero, a champion whose strength grows with their mathematical knowledge.

The narrative unfolds as the peaceful kingdom of Numeria falls under the shadow of the Demon King, a tyrant whose power is rooted in mathematical chaos. You, as the Digit Hero, are summoned by the king to embark on a perilous journey to restore order. Trained in the ancient ways of arithmetic by a wise sage, you begin your quest at the gates of a besieged castle, armed with the fundamental powers of Addition and Subtraction.

# Gameplay
The gameplay experience is divided into four progressive stages. The battle process involves solving an equation presented to the player, requiring basic calculations to determine the correct answer. If the answer is correct, it inflicts damage, earns a streak, and increases the damage of the next attack on the enemy. Otherwise, our hero will take damage. After defeating the current enemy, players can choose to either challenge the next enemy or return to the main menu. However, this process does not save the game, meaning players have to start from the first enemy again next time.

The player's journey culminates in an epic showdown with the Demon King. Victory in this final battle depends on the player's mastery of math. The game's difficulty scales with the player's progression, ensuring that the challenges remain stimulating and educational. 
This game is fully playable from start to finish, of course, this is contingent on the player's ability to defeat the last boss.

# Non-visual Elements:
The background music has a serious tone, building tension and encouraging focus. Sound effects during battles echo classic turn-based games, with chimes for correct answers and distinct tones for each mathematical operation. The game runs on PCs, primarily using mouse clicks for interaction.
